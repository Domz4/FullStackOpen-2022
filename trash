One of the first rap groups to sign with a record label in France, IAM has become a symbol of universality, authenticity and creativity over a 30-year career. From their 1989 debut in Marseille to 11th album 'Rimes Essentielles', released in 2021, IAM has made a place for themselves in people’s hearts and minds.

IAM has collaborated with legendary rappers and avant-gardes from around the world, including Khaled, Method Man & Redman, and Beyoncé, among others.

IAM is driven by authenticity, creativity and respect for their audience, no matter the project they're working on. It’s in this spirit that the group created their social token, $IAM, giving their community the opportunity to join Web3 and the future of the creative economy.
